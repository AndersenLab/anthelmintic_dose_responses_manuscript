## Abstract
Treatment of parasitic nematode infections in humans and livestock relies on a limited arsenal of anthelmintic drugs that have historically reduced parasite burdens. However, anthelmintic resistance (AR) is increasing, and little is known about the molecular and genetic causes of resistance for most drugs. The free-living roundworm *Caenorhabditis elegans* has proven to be a tractable model to understand AR, where studies have led to the identification of molecular targets of all major anthelmintic drug classes. Here, we used genetically diverse *C. elegans* strains to perform dose-response analyses across 26 anthelmintic drugs that represent the three major anthelmintic drug classes (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists) in addition to seven other anthelmintic classes. First, we found that *C. elegans* strains displayed similar anthelmintic responses within drug classes and significant variation across drug classes. Next, we compared the effective concentration estimates to induce a 10% maximal response (EC10) and slope estimates of each dose-response curve of each strain to the laboratory reference strain, which enabled the identification of anthelmintics with population-wide differences to understand how genetics contribute to AR. Because genetically diverse strains displayed differential susceptibilities within and across anthelmintics, we show that *C. elegans* is a useful model for screening potential nematicides before applications to helminths. Third, we quantified the levels of anthelmintic response variation caused by genetic differences among individuals (heritability) to each drug and observed a significant correlation between exposure closest to the EC10 and the exposure that exhibited the most heritable responses. These results suggest drugs to prioritize in genome-wide association studies, which will enable the identification of AR genes.
